            <article>Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one large, four-star
                resort. There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts. All types
                of lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.</article>

            <article> Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks
                in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate
                small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will
                be able to land on the island within the next few years.</article>

            <article> Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the
                rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local
                rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets
                are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area
                surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.</article>

        <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square
            miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
            tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an
            indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian economy was
            dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>
