            <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square
                miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
                tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an
                indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian economy
                was dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>
